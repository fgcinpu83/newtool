# Minimal Stable Arbitrage Engine

This repository is refactored to a Minimal Stable Engine architecture for a 2-account arbitrage system.

Goals
- Deterministic, user-driven flows for accounts A and B.
- Simple, explicit state transitions. No internal token guards, retries, or event-driven FSMs.

Architecture
- `WorkerService`: single orchestrator; holds `accounts` state for `A` and `B`.
- `BrowserAutomationService`: executor with two simple APIs: `openBrowser(account,url)` and `closeBrowser(account)`.
- `Extension`: marks provider via `PROVIDER_MARKED` event.
- `Stream detection`: first stream packet transitions account to `RUNNING`.

State Flow

IDLE → BROWSER_OPENING → BROWSER_READY → PROVIDER_READY → RUNNING → STOPPING → IDLE

User Workflow
- Set `urlA` / `urlB` via config
- Toggle ON (worker opens browser for account)
- Login & mark provider via extension (sends `PROVIDER_MARKED`)
- When first stream packet arrives, account state becomes `RUNNING`
- Toggle OFF closes browser and resets account

Principles
- Simplicity over complexity
- Deterministic transitions only
- No automatic retries or hidden fallback logic

See `backend/src/workers/worker.service.ts` and `backend/src/workers/browser.automation.ts` for implementation.

## 🔐 Phase 1 — Execution Hardening (new)

This release adds execution safety controls for the backend only (Phase 1 hardening).

- New environment variables (set as needed):
	- `EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_MS` — per-leg timeout in milliseconds (default: `30000`).
	- `MAX_EXPOSURE_PER_MATCH` — maximum stake per match per account in production (default: `1000`).
	- `MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE` — total maximum outstanding exposure per account in production (default: `5000`).

	Notes: exposure checks and the engine watchdog are bypassed in CI/test (when `process.env.CI === 'true'` or `NODE_ENV === 'test'`).

- SQLite additions/migration (auto-run on service start):
	- New table `execution_audit_log` with columns:
		- `id`, `timestamp`, `matchId`, `providerA`, `providerB`, `stakeA`, `stakeB`, `legA_status`, `legB_status`, `hedge_triggered`, `final_status`, `error_message`.
	- New table `hedge_events` with columns: `id`, `timestamp`, `auditId`, `details`.
	- Migration: `SqliteService.migrate()` will create tables and attempt to add missing columns safely on startup. The database file is by default at `<repo-root>/data/ag.sqlite`.

- Behavior guarantees:
	- Every execution attempt writes an audit row before any betting occurs; the engine aborts if the audit write fails (prevents un-audited runs).
	- Leg B will NOT run if Leg A fails.
	- If Leg A succeeds but Leg B fails (including timeout), a hedge attempt is triggered and persisted.
	- A per-process execution lock prevents double-running the same match. For multi-instance deployments, replace the in-memory exposure/lock with a shared store (Redis) if required.

Usage examples (Docker / env):

```powershell
# Build image (example)
docker build -t newtool-backend:local -f Dockerfile .

# Run with custom timeouts / exposure limits
docker run --rm -e EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_MS=40000 -e MAX_EXPOSURE_PER_MATCH=2000 -e MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE=8000 newtool-backend:local
```

If you need a multi-process-safe exposure store or to export audit data, I can add a Redis-backed implementation and a small query tool next.

🔒 Phase 1 Execution Hardening (v3.2)

This version introduces strict atomic execution, hedge protection, exposure caps, and mandatory audit logging.

⚙️ Environment Variables (Execution Safety)

You can configure execution behavior via environment variables:

```
EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_MS=30000          # Per-leg execution timeout (default: 30000ms)
MAX_EXPOSURE_PER_MATCH=1000         # Max exposure per match (per account)
MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE=5000             # Max total exposure per account (process memory)
```

Notes:

Exposure caps are enforced before execution.

In CI / test mode, exposure checks are bypassed.

If exposure exceeds limits, execution is rejected safely (no partial betting).

Timeouts trigger automatic hedge protocol if needed.

🧾 Execution Audit Logging (Mandatory)

Every arbitrage attempt now creates an audit record before any leg is executed.

SQLite Tables:

`execution_audit_log`

Field	Description
id	Primary key
timestamp	Execution start time
matchId	Canonical match ID
providerA	Provider A name
providerB	Provider B name
stakeA	Stake placed on A
stakeB	Stake placed on B
legA_status	success / failed / timeout
legB_status	success / failed / timeout
hedge_triggered	boolean
final_status	success / failed
error_message	nullable

Execution will abort if audit row cannot be written.

No execution is allowed without persistence.

🛡 Hedge Protocol

If:

Leg A succeeds

Leg B fails or times out

System automatically triggers hedge protocol:

`hedge.service.ts` → `executeHedge()`


Hedge events are persisted in:

`hedge_events`

Used for post-mortem analysis and exposure tracking.

🔐 Atomic Execution Model

Execution flow:

Acquire execution lock (per match).

Write audit row.

Validate exposure caps.

Execute Leg A.

Execute Leg B (only if Leg A succeeded).

Trigger hedge if Leg B fails.

Update audit row.

Release lock.

Double execution of same match is prevented.

👁 Engine Watchdog (Production Only)

In production mode:

Every 5 seconds the engine checks for:

Stale execution locks

Timeout violations

Automatically releases stale locks

Emits structured system_log events

Disabled in CI/test mode.

🧪 CI/Test Safety

When:

`CI=true`
or
`NODE_ENV=test`

No real Chrome spawn

No real CDP attach

Exposure limits bypassed

Watchdog disabled

Execution safe-mode active

Ensures deterministic CI.
